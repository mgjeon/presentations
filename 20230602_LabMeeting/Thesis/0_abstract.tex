This thesis presents a novel approach to calculate nonlinear force-free fields using physics-informed neural networks. 
The coronal magnetic fields, which are related to solar activities like coronal mass ejections and solar flares, can be approximated as  nonlinear force-free fields. 
In order to calculate  nonlinear force-free fields, the partial differential equation called the force-free equation has to be solved. 
Recently, physics-informed neural networks have emerged as a new method to solve partial differential equations using a computer. 
This study demonstrates that physics-informed neural networks can be used for calculating nonlinear force-free fields given by the Low-Lou model which is one of the semi-analytical solutions.

% and highlights their potential due to several special features, 
% including automatic differentiation, mesh-free method, neural network architecture, and modern programming language.
